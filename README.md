**EggSeed** is a command-line tool for creating swift pacakges with continous integration support. While `swift package init`, creates simple packages, there is no guarantee that your package will work on everyone else's device. That's where _continuous integration_ goes in. 

By using `eggseed`, you can create a package with full integration into CI services such as: _[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions), [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/), [BitRise](https://www.bitrise.io), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com)_ and more. Not only that but **EggSeed** also sets up code documentation, linting, and more...

Check out the [roadmap below](#roadmap) for more details on future integrations.

# Installation

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)
```sh
mint install brightdigit/EggSeed
```

### Swift Package Manager

**Use as CLI**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brightdigit/EggSeed.git
cd EggSeed
swift run eggseed
```

**Use as dependency**

Add the following to your Package.swift file's dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/brightdigit/EggSeed.git", from: "0.2.0"),
```

And then import wherever needed: `import EggSeed`

# Usage

```
USAGE: eggseed [--package-type <package-type>] [--user-name <user-name>] [--path <path>]

OPTIONS:
  --package-type <package-type>
                          Swift Package Type (default: library)
  --user-name <user-name> User name or Owner of Repostory. 
  --path <path>           Root path of the Swift Package. 
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

**Eggseed** can be run without any options. However there are a few options which can help customize your package:

## Package Type `--package-type` (library or executable)

Desginates what type of package you are creating.

## User Name `--user-name` 

The owner to user name of the repository. If not specified, EggSeed will attempt to parse the URL for that information.

## Path `--path`

Directory to create the Swift Package in, otherwise use the current directory.
